# html-css-practice(SuperSimpleDev's course)

This is the html-css practice from begginer to pro

I recommend if you don't know html and css to follow this course and assignment

The instruction is easy to understand and assignment is not so difficult 

but enough to practice writing code and understand key concepts of html and css
